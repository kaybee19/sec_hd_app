## SEC_HD_APP

A Help Desk Application using Oracle APEX


## Getting Started

This application is a basic helpdesk platform written with Oracle's Applicaton Express. The goal is to power ticketing and run an amazing customer helpcenter.

Installation is very easy, though an Oracle account with an active workspace is required. Simply create an account with Oracle and request a free workspace.

The application can also be installed on the local host. A active and working Oracle APEX enviroment must be running.
